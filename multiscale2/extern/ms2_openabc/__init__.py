ms2_openabc - Internalized OpenABC package

OpenABC (OpenMM GPU-Accelerated simulations of Biomolecular Condensates)
is a flexible package that implements multiple popular coarse-grained force fields
for simulations, including:
- HPS (Hydropathy Scale) model
- MOFF (Maximum Entropy Optimized Force Field) model
- Mpipi model
- SMOG+3SPN2 model

This is an internalized version of OpenABC for use within multiscale2.
